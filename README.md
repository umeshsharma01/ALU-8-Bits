# ALU-8-Bits
An Arithmetic Logic Unit is a core component of a computer processor responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on binary data.
It receives input operands from registers and executes operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and comparison based on control signals generated by the control unit. 
The ALU produces a result along with status flags such as zero, carry, overflow, and sign, which help in decision-making during program execution.
ALUs are built using fundamental digital circuits like adders, multiplexers, and logic gates.
Because it performs all essential calculations and logical decisions, the ALU plays a crucial role in the functioning of microprocessors, microcontrollers, and digital signal processing systems.
